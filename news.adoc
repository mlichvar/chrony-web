== 20 Aug 2020: chrony-3.5.1 released

=== Security fixes

* Create new file when writing pidfile (CVE-2020-14367)

=== CVE-2020-14367: Insecure writing of pidfile

When chronyd is configured to save the pidfile in a directory where the
chrony user has write permissions (e.g. /var/run/chrony - the default
since chrony-3.4), an attacker that compromised the chrony user account
could create a symbolic link at the location of the pidfile to make
chronyd starting with root privileges follow the symlink and write its
process ID to a file for which the chrony user doesn't have write
permissions, causing a denial of service, or data loss.

== 20 Jan 2016: chrony-2.2.1 and chrony-1.31.2 released

=== Security fixes

* Restrict authentication of NTP server/peer to specified key (CVE-2016-1567)

=== CVE-2016-1567: Impersonation between authenticated peers

When a server/peer was specified with a key number to enable
authentication with a symmetric key, packets received from the
server/peer were accepted if they were authenticated with any of
the keys contained in the key file and not just the specified key.

This allowed an attacker who knew one key of a client/peer to modify
packets from its servers/peers that were authenticated with other
keys in a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. For example, in a network
where each NTP association had a separate key and all hosts had only
keys they needed, a client of a server could not attack other clients
of the server, but it could attack the server and also attack its own
clients (i.e. modify packets from other servers).

To not allow the server/peer to be authenticated with other keys, the
authentication test was extended to check if the key ID in the received
packet is equal to the configured key number. As a consequence, it's
no longer possible to authenticate two peers to each other with two
different keys, both peers have to be configured to use the same key.

This issue was discovered by Matt Street of Cisco ASIG.

== 7 Apr 2015: chrony-1.31.1 released

=== Security fixes

* Protect authenticated symmetric NTP associations against DoS attacks
  (CVE-2015-1853)
* Fix access configuration with subnet size indivisible by 4 (CVE-2015-1821)
* Fix initialization of reply slots for authenticated commands (CVE-2015-1822)

=== CVE-2015-1853: DoS attack on authenticated symmetric NTP associations

An attacker knowing that NTP hosts A and B are peering with each other
(symmetric association) can send a packet with random timestamps to host A with
source address of B which will set the NTP state variables on A to the values
sent by the attacker. Host A will then send on its next poll to B a packet with
originate timestamp that doesn't match the transmit timestamp of B and the
packet will be dropped. If the attacker does this periodically for both hosts,
they won't be able to synchronize to each other.

Authentication using a symmetric key can fully protect against this attack, but
in implementations following the NTPv3 (RFC 1305) or NTPv4 (RFC 5905)
specification the state variables were updated even when the authentication
check failed and the association was not protected.

=== CVE-2015-1821: Heap-based buffer overflow in access configuration

When NTP or cmdmon access was configured (from chrony.conf or via authenticated
cmdmon) with a subnet size that is indivisible by 4 and an address that has
nonzero bits in the 4-bit subnet remainder (e.g. 192.168.15.0/22 or f000::/3),
the new setting was written to an incorrect location, possibly outside the
allocated array.

An attacker that has the command key and is allowed to access cmdmon (only
localhost is allowed by default) could exploit this to crash chronyd or
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the chronyd process.

=== CVE-2015-1822: Use of uninitialized pointer in command processing

When allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated command
requests, the last "next" pointer was not initialized to NULL. When all
allocated reply slots were used, the next reply could be written to an invalid
memory instead of allocating a new slot for it.

An attacker that has the command key and is allowed to access cmdmon (only
localhost is allowed by default) could exploit this to crash chronyd or
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the chronyd process.
