== Client using public servers

A common configuration of `chronyd` is a client using public servers from
the `pool.ntp.org` project. It is the default configuration included in many
packages of `chrony`.

The configuration file could be:

----
pool pool.ntp.org iburst
driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
makestep 0.1 3
rtcsync
----

The servers used by the client are selected randomly by the pool DNS servers
from the country of the client (according to IP geolocation data, which are not
always accurate). The polling interval is automatically adjusted between the
default minimum of 64 and maximum of 1024 seconds. As the client is running, it
should slowly increase its polling interval to the maximum and reduce the load
on the servers.

Accuracy of the system clock is usually within a few milliseconds, but it can
be significantly worse, depending on how symmetric are network routes between
the servers and client, how stable is the network delay and client's clock, and
how accurate are the servers themselves.

The set of servers can change on each restart of the client. There can be a
significant offset between different clients in a local network using the same
configuration.

Example reports from `chronyc` on a client using the configuration:

The offset from the client's tracking log (the 7th column in the file) is
shown in the graph below as dots.
That is the error of the system clock that `chronyd` is assuming from its
measurements and correcting. The red line is the actual error of the clock
measured by a separate monitoring instance of `chronyd` using a GPS reference
clock, which was not adjusting the system clock.

image::img/client-swts-public.png[]

In this test the clock was off by about 2-3 milliseconds most of the time, but
there were some large excursions in the error, one reaching about 8
milliseconds. They could be reduced by limiting the maximum polling interval
(e.g. to 64 seconds), but that would increase the load on the public servers.

== Client using local server and software timestamping

A local server with its own reference clock (e.g. a GPS receiver) is needed if
better accuracy is required on clients. They should be configured with a
shorter polling interval and have the interleaved mode enabled if supported on
the server (e.g. if it runs `chronyd`). Multiple servers should be used for
reliability. 

In this example the client uses a single server with a polling interval of 4
seconds and software timestamping (the default).

There were three network switches between the server and client in the test.
The network was loaded with 20-second data transfers from the client to the
server every minute.

The following graph shows the client's tracking offset and the actual error of
the system clock measured with a local reference clock with a sub-microsecond
accuracy.

image::img/client-swts-3switch.png[]

The clock was stable to about 2 microseconds. There was a constant error of
about 5 microseconds, which was caused mainly by asymmetric errors in software
timestamps used by the client. The server used hardware timestamps with
insignificant errors when compared to the client. If the server used software
timestamping and had the same hardware, OS, and configuration as the client,
the asymmetry could cancel out, but the synchronisation would be less stable.

== Client using local server and hardware timestamping

For best accuracy it is necessary to use a NIC which supports hardware
timestamping. In this example the client and server both have the Intel I210
card. They also both run `chrony` version 4.2, which supports the experimental
extension field F323 improving synchronisation stability. The client is
configured to send 16 requests per second and filter 5 measurements at a time,
making about 3 updates of the clock per second. The polling of the hardware
clock matches the minimum polling interval of the NTP source.

The Intel I210 has timestamping errors compensated in the Linux `igb` driver
(it is not necessary to compensate them with the `rxcomp` and `txcomp` options
in the `hwtimestamp` directive). For better stability, Energy-Efficient
Ethernet (EEE) was disabled in the network and the CPU on both server and
client was set to a constant frequency.

There were three network switches between the server and client in the test.
The network was loaded with 20-second data transfers from the client to the
server every minute. Network load typically has only a small impact on accuracy
of hardware timestamping, but it can cause an NTP packet to be queued in a
switch and cause a large error in the NTP measurement due to asymmetric delay.
As long as this does not happen for too many measurements in a row, the client
should be able to ignore the impacted measurements and keep the clock well
synchronised. Some switches can be configured to prioritise NTP packets (by
port number or DSCP) to limit the queueing delays.

The NTP measurements and the clock were stable to few tens of nanoseconds.
Measuring accuracy of the system clock at this level is difficult. The main
problem is communication over the PCIe bus between the system clock (CPU) and
the NIC, which can have an asymmetric latency causing errors in the readings of
the hardware clock up to a few hundred nanoseconds.

The following graph shows the client's tracking offset and an error of the
clock measured with a PPS signal (shared with the server) connected to the NIC.

image::img/client-hwts-3switch-f323.png[]

The asymmetry of about 70 nanoseconds is caused by the network switches. It is
common for switches to have a different forwarding delay from port A to port B
than from port B to port A and different asymmetries on different pairs of
ports.

Other asymmetries in this test should cancel out due to the server and client
using the same model of the NIC for timestamping of NTP packets and
timestamping of the shared PPS signal (connected with cables of equal length).
If the error due to PCIe latency was not larger than 100 nanoseconds, the
system clock would be accurate to about 250 nanoseconds relative to the
reference clock of the server.

== Server using reference clock on serial port 

One of the easier ways to make a stratum-1 NTP server is to connect a GPS
receiver to a serial port of the computer. The receiver needs to provide a
pulse per second (PPS) signal to enable accuracy at the microsecond level. It
is usually connected to the DCD pin of the port. The `gpsd` daemon can combine
the serial data with PPS and provide a SHM or SOCK reference clock for
`chronyd`.

The following example uses the SOCK refclock:

----
refclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock
makestep 0.1 3
allow
rtcsync
driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
leapsectz right/UTC
----

`gpsd` needs to be started after `chronyd` in order to connect to the socket
and it needs to be started with the `-n` option to not wait for clients to
connect before polling the receiver. For example:

----
# gpsd -n /dev/ttyS0
----

The following graph shows the tracking offset and the error of the system clock
measured with a more accurate reference clock (PPS signal connected to a
hardware clock on the NIC).

image::img/server-serial.png[]

The clock was off by about 20 microseconds most of the time. Most of this error
is caused by hardware and software delays in timestamping of the interrupt
triggered by the serial port. The main issue is stability of the delay. There
are periods where it is significantly shorter, which causes the offset to jump
by about 12 microsecond. The CPU was set to a constant frequency in this test.
The jumps were probably caused by changes in the CPU load or changes in timing
of some processes, which prevented it from entering a power-saving state before
the interrupts and avoided the delay of waking up.

Disabling power-saving states (e.g. with the Linux kernel `idle=poll` option)
would make the delay more stable, but it would increase the power consumption.

The server did not use hardware timestamping, which means a similar issue with
interrupts impacted its software timestamps. The delay is sensitive to CPU load
and also network load as NICs implement interrupt coalescing in order to reduce
their rate. The following graph shows an example of errors in software receive
and transmit timestamps.

image::img/swts-error.png[]

On some NICs the coalescing can be limited or disabled with the `ethtool -C`
command (on Linux) to improve the timestamping stability.

== Server using reference clock on NIC

The best way to make a highly accurate stratum-1 NTP server is to connect the
PPS signal to a software defined pin (SDP) on the NIC which is receiving
requests and sending responses to NTP clients. This allows the PPS signal to be
timestamped in hardware, avoiding the PCIe and interrupt delays, with the same
clock as is timestamping NTP packets, which cancels out any asymmetry between
the system clock and hardware clock in the server's timestamps of NTP packets.

In this example the server has the Intel I210 card, which has a 6-pin header on
the board exposing two SDPs (3.3V level) with the following layout:

----
+-------------+
| GND  | SDP0 |
+-------------+
| GND  | SDP1 |
+-------------+
|  ?   |  ?   |
+-------------+
----

A 16Hz PPS signal from a u-blox NEO-6M GPS receiver is connected to SDP0. The
receiver is connected also to a USB port for the serial data to be processed by
`gpsd` to provide the `SHM 0` refclock needed for PPS locking. The timing
stability of the received messages limits the maximum rate of PPS. At 16 Hz,
the `SHM 0` refclock needs to be accurate to 25 milliseconds in order for the
PHC refclock to correctly and reliably lock to it.

The following command (executed when `gpsd` is running) configures the receiver
to make 16 pulses per second with 50% duty cycle and compensate a 20ns antenna
cable delay:

----
$ ubxtool -p CFG-TP5,0,20,0,1,16,0,2147483648,0,111
----

To improve stability of reading of the hardware clock, the CPU is set to a
constant frequency with disabled boosting:

----
# cpupower frequency-set -g userspace -d 3600000 -u 3600000
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost
----

The server has the following configuration:

----
refclock PHC /dev/ptp0:extpps:pin=0 dpoll -4 poll -2 rate 16 width 0.03125 refid GPS lock NMEA maxlockage 32
refclock SHM 0 refid NMEA noselect offset 0.120 poll 6 delay 0.010
hwtimestamp * minpoll -4
makestep 0.1 3
allow
rtcsync
driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
leapsectz right/UTC
----

The `extpps` option enables external PPS timestamping on the PHC. The `pin=0`
setting selects the SDP0 pin. The `dpoll` option configures the driver to poll
16 times per second and with the `poll` option it provides a median measurement
4 times per second. The `rate` option specifies the 16Hz PPS rate. The `width`
option is needed to filter falling edges in the PPS signal as the hardware
clock timestamps both edges. It specifies 50% of the 16Hz PPS interval,
matching the receiver PPS configuration. The `maxlockage` option is needed to
enable locking of the PPS to the SHM refclock providing only one sample per
second.

The `offset` option of the `SHM 0` refclock compensates for the delay of
messages received on the USB port. It needs to be measured carefully, e.g.
against a known good NTP server. A wrong offset could cause the server to be
off by an integer multiple of 62.5 milliseconds (1/16s). 

The hardware timestamping errors are already compensated in the kernel `igb`
driver for the I210.

The following graph shows the tracking offset:

It shows that `chronyd` can track the reference clock to about 20 nanoseconds.
A better reference clock would be needed to measure the accuracy and stability.
In this case they are probably limited by the GPS receiver - it is a cheap
non-timing-grade model without a stabilised oscillator.
