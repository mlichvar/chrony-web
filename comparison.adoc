= Comparison of NTP implementations

This document compares features and performance of the following NTP
implementations:

- https://chrony-project.org[chrony-4.2]

- http://www.openntpd.org/portable.html[openntpd-6.2p3 (portable)]

Presence of the features was determined from the documentation, observed
behaviour, and source code. There may be mistakes, please let us know if you
find any.

[[Performance]]
== Performance

This is a comparison of accuracies that can be achieved when the NTP
implementations are used as NTP clients in various clock and network
conditions. The accuracy of the synchronized clock was measured in a
https://gitlab.com/chrony/clknetsim[simulated Linux environment]. The
results are mean values and standard deviations from 100 simulations. The
values are in microseconds.

=== Test 1: permanent network connection and stable clock

In this test with one NTP server the clients were using their default
polling configuration. The clock was relatively stable (1ppb/s wander).

[cols="<.^2h,3*^.^1",width="83%",options="header"]
|==========================================================
| Network jitter                     | `chrony`| `ntp`   | `openntpd`
| 10 μs | 35 ± 8 | 234 ± 46 | 857 ± 226
| 100 μs | 109 ± 14 | 256 ± 50 | 888 ± 221
| 1.0 ms | 475 ± 93 | 454 ± 94 | 980 ± 262
| 10.0 ms | 1603 ± 447 | 3665 ± 651 | 2014 ± 387
|==========================================================

=== Test 2: permanent network connection and less stable clock

In this test the polling interval of the clients was fixed to 64 seconds and
the clock was less stable (10ppb/s wander). `openntpd` couldn't be included
as its polling interval is not configurable.

| 10.0 ms | 750 ± 91 | 1467 ± 100 | N/A
|==========================================================

=== Test 3: intermittent network connection

In this test the network was available to the clients only for 30 continuous
minutes every 24 hours. The polling interval configuration and the clock wander
were the same as in the first test.

[[Summary]]
== Summary

=== `chrony` vs `ntp` and `ntpsec`

Things `chrony` can do better than `ntp` and `ntpsec`:

* `chrony` can perform usefully in an environment where access to the time
  reference is intermittent. `ntp` and `ntpsec` need regular polling of the
  reference to work well.
* `chrony` can usually synchronise the clock faster and with better time
  accuracy.
* `chrony` quickly adapts to sudden changes in the rate of the clock (e.g. due
  to changes in the temperature of the crystal oscillator). `ntp` and `ntpsec`
  may need a long time to settle down again.
* `chrony` can perform well even when the network is congested for longer
  periods of time.
* `chrony` in the default configuration never steps the time to not upset
  other running programs. `ntp` and `ntpsec` can be configured to never step
  the time too, but in that case it has to use a different means of adjusting
  the clock (daemon loop instead of kernel discipline), which may have a
  negative effect on accuracy of the clock.
* `chrony` can adjust the rate of the clock in a larger range, which allows it
  to operate even on machines with broken or unstable clock (e.g. in some
  virtual machines).
* `chrony` is smaller, it uses less memory and it wakes up the CPU only when
  necessary, which is better for power saving.

Things `chrony` can do that `ntp` and `ntpsec` can't:

* `chrony` supports the Network Time Security (NTS) authentication mechanism
  (supported by `ntpsec`, but not `ntp`).
* `chrony` supports hardware timestamping on Linux, which allows an extremely
  stable and accurate synchronisation in local network.
* `chrony` provides support for isolated networks whether the only method of
  time correction is manual entry (e.g. by the administrator looking at a
  clock). `chrony` can look at the errors corrected at different updates to
  work out the rate at which the computer gains or loses time, and use this
  estimate to trim the computer clock subsequently.
* `chrony` provides support to work out the gain or loss rate of the
  real-time clock, i.e. the clock that maintains the time when the computer is
  turned off. It can use this data when the system boots to set the system time
  from a corrected version of the real-time clock. These real-time clock
  facilities are only available on Linux, so far.

Things `ntpsec` can do that `chrony` can't:

* `ntpsec` includes drivers for most current hardware reference clocks, although
  fewer than `ntp`.

Things `ntp` can do that `chrony` can't:

* `ntp` supports all operating modes from RFC 5905, including broadcast,
  multicast, and manycast server/client. However, the broadcast and multicast
  modes are inherently less accurate and less secure (even with authentication)
  than the ordinary server/client mode, and should generally be avoided.
* `ntp` supports the Autokey protocol (RFC 5906) to authenticate servers with
  public-key cryptography. Note that the protocol has been shown to be insecure
  and has been obsoleted by NTS (RFC 8915).
* `ntp` has been ported to more operating systems.
* `ntp` includes a large number of drivers for various hardware reference
  clocks. `chrony` requires other programs (e.g. `gpsd` or `ntp-refclock`) to
  provide reference time via the `SHM` or `SOCK` interface.
